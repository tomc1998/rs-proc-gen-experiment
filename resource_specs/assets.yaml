## What follows is the documentation for assets.

Assets:
  # Assets are defined in YAML. Assets include: Textures, Animations, Tilesets,
  # and Bitmap Fonts. In the future, they may also include sounds.
  #
  # Each asset is named with a unique name, and can be referenced in other
  # resource definitions, like for defining an item type.
  # # Directory structure
  # The directory structure for item types is simple.
  # Asset definition files are placed in the res/asset-definitions directory.
  # File names don't matter.
  # Each file contains a list of asset definitions, which are asset names
  # mapped to other data. Here is a (commented) example of an asset definition -
  # one or more of these would make up an asset definition file:

  # This is the name of the asset. Convention is a upper CamelCase name.
  Tex:
    # This type informs the rest of the structure. See further examples below for
    # different asset types.
    name: "IconMoney"
    # Filename is relative to the project root
    filename: "res/sprites/icon/money.png"



More asset examples:

  # animsprite example
  - Anim:
      name: "SliceAnim"
      filename: "res/sprites/fx/slice-00.png"
      # see 'frameset definitions' below.
      frame_set: slice_frame_set
      # width and height (in pixels) of individual frames in the sprite sheet
      frame_w: 8
      frame_h: 8

  # Tileset example
  - Tileset:
      name: "TilesetGrass"
      filename: "res/tileset-grass.png"
      # Width and height (in pixels) of individual tiles in the sprite sheet
      frame_w: 8
      frame_h: 8

  # Anim icon example (this is just a texture, but is generated from the first
  # frame of an animation
  - AnimIcon:
      name: "IconBronzeHelmet"
      # Reference another animation
      anim: BronzeHelmetAnim
      # X, Y, W, H:
      # Additional cropping parameters, to crop the first frame.
      # From 0 to 1, where 0,0 is the top left of the frame, and the frame has a
      # w/h of 1/1
      # # OOB offsets
      # Given that the spacing for stuff is SPACING, you can go OOB with x, y by
      # a small amount depending on the pixel spacing. This is not recommend
      # however, as a change in the spacing will fuck some icons up subtly.
      x: 0.0
      y: 0.0
      w: 1.0
      h: 1.0

  # Bitmap font example
  - BitmapFont:
      name: "FontTinyNumbers"
      filename: "res/sprites/ui/tiny-numbers.png"
      # Width / height of glyphs
      frame_w: 8
      frame_h: 8
      # A map of chars to frame positions
      char_map:
        # An x, y offset (in frames) from the top-left of the image.
        "1": [0, 0]
        "2": [1, 0]
        "3": [2, 0]
        "4": [3, 0]
        "5": [4, 0]
        "6": [0, 1]
        "7": [1, 2]
        "8": [2, 3]
        "9": [3, 4]
        "0": [4, 5]

FrameSet Definitions:
  # Currently the only supported framset type is Ordered. Here is an example of
  # the walking animations for the human anim.

  FrameSet:
    name: "human_anim_frame_set"
    frames: 
      - type: Ordered # Walk down
        start: 0
        end: 3
      - type: Ordered # Walk up
        start: 4
        end: 7
      - type: Ordered # Walk right
        start: 8
        end: 11
      # You can also use a more compact JSON notation
      - { type: Ordered, start: 12, end: 15 } # Walk left
